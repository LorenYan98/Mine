* **2019.08 – 2019.12**  
  **Framework of seismic fragilities for wood structures** (McGill University), 
    * Investigated the mechanism of damage-index based fragility analysis through the definition based on the formula.
       * ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?P\left[d_s\geq C\vert S_a\right]=\phi\left[\frac{\ln(S_d)-\ln(S_{d,ds})}{\sqrt{\beta_c^2+\beta_d^2+\beta_m^2}}\right])
    * Utilized the Park-Ang (1985) Damage Index Model to determine the DI of a single shear wall.
    * Correlated the Damage Index of a single shear wall to the DI of the whole structure by the weight factor, ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?DI_{structure}=\;{\textstyle{\displaystyle\overset n{\underset{i=1}{\sum\lambda}}}i_{wall}\ast DI_{wall}})
    * Determined potential factors influencing seismic responses of light-frame wood structures by analyzing their fragility curves via different retrofit strategies.

  **Pushover analysis for reinforced concrete structures** (McGill University), 
    * Investigated the mechanism of pushover analysis and the derivation of the demand& capacity curve for the capacity spectrum method.
    * Constructed the 3D-model for a three-story reinforced concrete building (Richmond, BC) with SAP2000.
      * Hinge type refers to ASCE 41-13, Table 10-7
    * Performed Pushover analysis on the structure subjected to different earthquake levels; Statistically analyzed the data collected and their corresponding capacity spectrum, using SAP2000 to determine the seismic resistance of the structure.
    * Identified and analyzed potential restraints regarding the Pushover analysis and cooperated the capacity spectrum method with it to optimize the prediction of responses for high-mode buildings.
