Abstract
===
Light-frame wood-dwellings in Canada are vulnerable to seismic hazards since most of the wood-frame residences were built before the introduction of a proper national building code. Although wood structures perform well under normal gravity and lateral loading, poorly designed seismic resistance can lead to damages to existing wood-frame buildings during hazards as well as causing substantial financial loss and widespread destruction. This paper reviews the mechanism and results from a full-scale shake table test performed under the NEESWood Project (2007), which provides valuable data on seismic responses of wood-frame structures. Next, the study is extended to the calibration of the Damage Index model, which provides empirical constants as a part of the fragility analysis. The paper first investigates how the results from the shake table test can be used in calibrating the Damage Index, followed by an implementation of the calibrated model in fragility analysis to study the probabilistic relationships between seismic motions and structural failures. A case study of a two-story baseline wood structure (Fisher et al.2001) is illustrated. Finally, by comparing changes in fragility curves before and after retrofits, the paper studies the relative effectiveness of different retrofitting strategies, such as the installation of sheathing nails, gypsum wallboards, and anchor bolts.
