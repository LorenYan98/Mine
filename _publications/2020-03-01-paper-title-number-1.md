Abstract
===
A comprehensive seismic analysis system is essential for the prediction of structural responses. The static pushover analysis has been widely used in seismic analysis due to its accessible concepts and convenient computations as well as the ability to effectively evaluate the seismic performance. The mechanism of pushover analysis and its implementation are investigated in this paper. Then, by studying the hinge states of structural members, the paper identifies conditions under which the pushover will provide adequate information as well as the cases where the pushover will not. As a complementary approach with pushover analysis, the mechanism of the capacity spectrum method is illustrated. The paper composes these two methods together to form a seismic analyzing model, which tends to minimize the potential drawback of pushover analysis and enable a more accurate prediction of structural responses during an earthquake. A case study of a multi-story reinforced concrete building (Richmond BC) is used to verify the feasibility of the model by comparing the predictions of seismic responses before and after the improvement.
